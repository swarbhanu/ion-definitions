  process_batch:
    docstring:  |
      This method is launched when an process_batch event is received. The user info dictionary maintained
      by the User Notification Service is used to query the event repository for all events for a particular
      user that have occurred in a certain time interval (right now the past 24 hours), and then an email
      is sent to the user containing the digest of all the events.

    in:
      start_time: ''
      end_time: ''
    out:

  set_process_batch_key:
    docstring:  |
      This method is used by the operator to set the process_batch_key, a string, that the UNS will listen
      for as the origin of a timer event. When the scheduler publishes a timer event with origin set equal
      to the value of the process_batch_key, the UNS will launch its process_batch() method, resulting
      in an email being sent to the subscribed users with a message body that details all the relevant
      events that have occurred in between timer events.
    in:
      process_batch_key: ""
    out:

  get_subscriptions:
    docstring:  |
      This method is used to get the subscriptions to resource id. The method will return a list of NotificationRequest
      objects for whom the origin is set to this resource id. This way all the users who were interested in listening to
      events with origin equal to this resource id, will be known and all their subscriptions will be known.
    in:
      resource_id: ""
      include_nonactive: False
    out:
      notification_requests: []
